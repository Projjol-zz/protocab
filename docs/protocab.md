# protocab (wip)

- use dht like system to keep list of drivers available [need more logic on this as availability + location has to be criteria]
    - possibly use multiple location based dhts? [i.e as a cab moves and updates his dht changes, probably need to read up on how dynamic urls are handled?
- when new user submits request, check in that dht and connect to cab
- via smart contract keep in escrow amount to be paid, post successful confirmation of trip transfer money and commission
    - driver will always confirm because (s)he would like to be paid for the service provided but client might turn out to be rogue
    - in this case next ride cannot be booked by the user till previous smart contract has not been cleared
    - some form of a master switch? i.e if user does not confirm and never uses the service again how is payment processed?
        - x number of retries post which network defaults payment for driver? too much power to driver ? can it incentivize bad behaviour on their part?
